				<p>Humankind has no backup plan. We could be hit by a massive natural disaster — a solar storm, an untracked asteroid (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor" target="_blank" >like this one</a>), a supervolcanic eruption. We could fall prey to a human-created catastrophe — nuclear war, climate change, water shortages. Some of these events could irrevocably change our way of life, while others could destroy not just humanity, but all organisms on Earth. It may not happen in our lifetime, our children’s lifetime, or their children's lifetime, but it will happen. To preserve life, we must journey to the stars.</p>

				<p>There is a possibility that we may find living organisms elsewhere in the universe. This discovery would have massive repercussions for humanity. We would concretely know that our planet is not alone in harboring life and that, if there is life outside our solar system in one location, then there may be in others too. What we find may be big, but will likely be small. Finding such microorganisms would help us to trace life on Earth back to its roots, compare our biology to that of an extraterrestrial's, and answer many other questions about the origin of life in the universe. Answering these questions would lead to substantial progress in targeted treatments for diseases, therapies for genetic disorders, discovering the mechanisms by which many conditions and medications act on the body, and much more.</p>

				<p>Space exploration offers us a multitude of opportunities to create new technologies that solve new problems. With history as our guide, we can see the numerous positive technologies that have arisen out of our desire to achieve the stars — scratch-resistant lenses, advancements in artificial limbs, lightweight firefighting equipment, freeze-dried food, solar cells for solar panels, systems to purify water, improved food safety, and devices that aid the body's natural functions (e.g. heart assists and insulin pumps). All of these technological advances emerged from our exploration of space near Earth. Imagine what new technologies we'll be offered the opportunity to create when we range out even farther into the cosmos.</p>

				<p>Precious resources from our planet — water, rare metals, common metals, and even gases — are necessary to humankind's survival and progress as a species. These resources are not completely renewable and, within the next one hundred years, we will face problems with increasing costs and decreasing supplies. Fortunately, asteroids, comets, and other objects in our solar system are theorized to have vast quantities of these precious resources. Water has been observed on the dwarf planet Ceres in the asteroid belt, and scientists estimate that if even 25% of Ceres were composed of water, then it would contain more water than there is fresh water on Earth. Other asteroids may contain more rare metals than have been found on Earth since humanity began mining. We need not experience any crises due to lack of these resources on our planet, as massive quantities of them exist within our grasp. We have only to reach out and harvest them.</p>

				<h1>6<hr class="topHr"><hr></h1>
				<p>Humanity has ever been driven by the idea that we could make the future a little bit better — for ourselves, for our children, and for our children's children. By the idea that, if we dreamt it, we could create it. By the idea that, even if we didn't know everything, we could discover something. There has been no endeavor in human history that has made us hope more, innovate more, or wonder more than the exploration of space. To limit ourselves to only our planet would be to deny ourselves these basic ideas. We do not limit our children to their cradles; we encourage them to venture outwards — to explore, to wonder, and to grow. The Earth is our cradle, and it's time we crawled out of it.</p>
